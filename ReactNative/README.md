## Description
Platform-independent app created with React Native.

## Install

1) Install npm.
2) Install the npm package `react-native-cli` globally with `npm install -g react-native-cli`.
3) Make sure that you have Java 8 JDK and Android Studio (Android SDK) installed.  
4) Make sure you have a Java reference in your PATH variable on windows.
6) Navigate to your project directory and execute `npm install`.
7) Connect your android phone to the computer or start the android emulator.
8) After that execute the command `react-native run-android` in your project folder to compile the app and to load it to the phone or emulator.

## Run on iOS

The app was not configured for iOS during development (e. g. the splashscreen plugin was not adjusted to iOS => see GitHub page of the plugin). 
With some additional adjustments it would also be possible to run the app on iOS with `react-native run-ios`.
