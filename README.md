## Description
This repository contains the source code of four mobile apps, which were created with different frameworks (Android SDK, Ionic/Cordova, React Native and Flutter).
The apps were used to evaluate different platform-independent development approaches.

Each framework folder contains a short description on how to compile and install the app on your computer. In addition, you find a link to the Play Store, where you can download the app.
